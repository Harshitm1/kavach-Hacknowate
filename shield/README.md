## Technical Details

### Security Scoring
The Safety Score is calculated based on multiple factors:
- HTTPS usage (secure connection)
- Presence of tracking scripts
- Phishing indicators
- Domain reputation
- TLD security level
- Mixed content detection
- Domain age and complexity

### AI Integration with agent.ai
Kavach integrates with agent.ai to provide intelligent security analysis:

- **API Integration**: Uses the agent.ai API for generating security advice
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafts detailed context-aware prompts with security information
- **Response Processing**: Processes and presents AI responses in a user-friendly format
- **Security Notifications**: Generates personalized security notifications for websites
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Provides a conversational interface for security questions

Key integration points:
- `js/chatbot-service.js`: Main service handling API communication
- `js/popup.js`: Integration with the UI for user interaction
- `js/background.js`: Background security analysis and notifications
- `js/content.js`: On-page security assessments and notifications

### Anti-Fingerprinting Methods
The extension employs multiple techniques to prevent browser fingerprinting:
- Canvas fingerprinting protection
- WebGL fingerprinting protection
- User agent normalization
- Audio fingerprinting protection
- Font fingerprinting protection
- Screen resolution spoofing

### Privacy Considerations
- All data is stored locally on your device
- Only security analysis queries are sent to agent.ai (no personal data)
- Export functionality allows you to save/backup your data
- VPN connection data never leaves your device

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Chrome or Chromium-based browser
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Understanding of Chrome extension architecture

   ```javascript
   config: {
     apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
     apiUrl: 'https://api-lr.agent.ai/v1/action/invoke_llm',
     engine: 'gpt4o'
   }
   ```

### Building from Source
